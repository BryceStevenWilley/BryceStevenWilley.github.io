I'm Bryce, a Master's Student at Rice University working in the [Kavraki Lab](http://www.kavrakilab.org/)
with [Lydia Kavraki](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~kavraki/) and [Mark Moll](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~mmoll/)
on autonomous robotic motion.

I also have a side hobby of making video games: take a 
look [here](/projects) to see more.

I run, cycle, volunteer at [BARC](http://www.houstontx.gov/barc/), and take my own pup, Jackie, for lots of long walks.
