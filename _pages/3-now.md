## What is this?

It's a now page: what I'm focused on at the moment, both professionally and personally.
It's what I'd tell on old co-worker if we met up for a 30 minute lunch.
Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff).
Trying to keep it updated at least monthly.

Last updated June 1st, 2022.

## Professional

### Work Stuff

Still at [Suffolk Law School's Legal Innovation and Technology (LIT) Lab](https://suffolklitlab.org/), working on court form software.
My main focus right now is to get our [efile-proxy](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/EfileProxyServer) (and corresponding [docassemble library](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-EFSPIntegration)) ready for a 1.0 release. At this point it just means getting access to the production court software, so I'm polishing all that I can while we wait for that.

It also means making sure that [docassemble](https://docassemble.org) and our guided interviews built on top of it are accessible. I've done a lot of work there, and will likely do a full (non-expert) audit myself soon, and hopefully can finish my blog post about that experience.

<p><span id="event-title">Made a pull request</span> in the <a id="event-repo" href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-ALToolbox">SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-ALToolbox</a> repo.</p>

<blockquote id="event-desc"><p>Correct `aria-controls` to refernce correct id</p><p></p><p>Issue was caught by aXe-core testing: https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.4/aria-valid-attr-value?application=axe-puppeteer
</p><p>
</p><p>The issue happened because `tag_group_name` was added to the beginning of each id / href, but not to aria-controls.
</p><p>The `tab_id` was never used individually, so I just updated it to include both `tab_group_name` and `tab_id`,
</p><p>and then replaced its used in the tabs and tab panels.</p></blockquote>

### Long Term Career Stuff

My position at the LIT Lab is grant funded, and ends in Q3 2023, so I'll be
looking for a new gig around then! I have a variety of different tech skill sets,
and am not concerned about developing a few more. But I am more interested in making sure
that I work at a place [helps under-served communities help themselves]({% post_url 2021-06-20-new_job %}),
and developing the skills to do that well.

## Personal

### Doing

Planning a wedding and trying to find a new apartment takes up most of my free time.

### Listening To

Listened to Kendrick Lamar's latest album, Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers, a few times, and thought about it a lot. It is a well-made
album, I have a lot of conflicting thoughts about it, but it's definitely the first time in a while I've engaged with music this deeply.

Have also been listening to a mix of 90's hip hop and some classic J-pop.

[//]: steps for gathering: next time, just copy the album links (ctrl-shift-right click to inspect) and type info directly, lolW

### Gaming

Playing a lot of the new Mario Kart 8 Deluxe tracks. Ninja Hideaway is pretty fun.

Playing through "It Takes Two" from Hazelight and EA with my fiance, and it's really good so far! The story is wacky, but
the gameplay is a great balance, challenging but not frustrating.

On and off playing through Red Dead Redemption 2. Parts can be fun, but hasn't hooked me enough to try to trudge through
the story.

### Watching

The movie "Everything Everywhere All at Once" is a gem, go see it.

Stranger Things 4 part 1 is really good, definitely got me excited for part 2 after not particularly loving season 3.
