## What is this?

It's a now page: what I'm focused on at the moment, both professionally and personally.
It's what I'd tell on old co-worker if we met up for a 30 minute lunch.
Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff).
Trying to keep it updated at least monthly.

Last updated July 7th, 2022.

## Professional

### Work Stuff

Still at [Suffolk Law School's Legal Innovation and Technology (LIT) Lab](https://suffolklitlab.org/), working on court form software.
My main focus right now is to get our [efile-proxy](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/EfileProxyServer) (and corresponding [docassemble library](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-EFSPIntegration)) ready for a 1.0 release. At this point it just means getting access to the production court software, so I'm polishing all that I can while we wait for that. It also means trying to get an API that makes sense in docassemble, a thing that I'm
finding a bit difficult to do well.

Trying to find time to start implementing our "LIT Styler" tool, which will put into effect a lot of thinking I've already done about form "completion ease" and readability.

<!-- It also means making sure that [docassemble](https://docassemble.org) and our guided interviews built on top of it are accessible. I've done a lot of work there, and will likely do a full (non-expert) audit myself soon, and hopefully can finish my blog post about that experience. -->

<p><span id="event-title">Made a pull request</span> in the <a id="event-repo" href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-ALToolbox">SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-ALToolbox</a> repo.</p>

<blockquote id="event-desc"><p>Correct `aria-controls` to refernce correct id</p><p></p><p>Issue was caught by aXe-core testing: https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.4/aria-valid-attr-value?application=axe-puppeteer
</p><p>
</p><p>The issue happened because `tag_group_name` was added to the beginning of each id / href, but not to aria-controls.
</p><p>The `tab_id` was never used individually, so I just updated it to include both `tab_group_name` and `tab_id`,
</p><p>and then replaced its used in the tabs and tab panels.</p></blockquote>

### Long Term Career Stuff

My position at the LIT Lab is grant funded, and ends in Q3 2023, so I'll be
looking for a new gig around then! I have a variety of different tech skill sets,
and am not concerned about developing a few more. But I am more interested in making sure
that I work at a place [helps under-served communities help themselves]({% post_url 2021-06-20-new_job %}),
and developing the skills to do that well (like partnership building).

## Personal

### Doing

Planning a wedding and getting ready to move apartments takes up most of my free time. Took a week long vacation that was just vacation, not
traveling to see family or anything, and it was pretty fun.

### Listening To

Have shifted hard into jazz/jazz-fusion and vaporwave/future-funk recently. Sometimes you just need some bops

[//]: steps for gathering: next time, just copy the album links (ctrl-shift-right click to inspect) and type info directly, lolW

### Gaming

Slowly making my way through the [Bundle for Ukraine](https://itch.io/b/1316/bundle-for-ukraine) that I snagged a few months ago.
Some favorites that I've tried so far:

* [Speed Dating for Ghosts](https://copychaser.itch.io/speeddatingforghosts): really well written, funny but surprisingly poignant
* [BOTOLO](https://auren-snyder.itch.io/botolo): an interesting multiplayer game with great visuals. The single player AI is pretty good too (or I just suck, who knows)
* [Baba Is You](https://hempuli.itch.io/baba): deserves it's acclaim, it's hard, but not too hard, and the logic system is just really fun to play around with

### Watching

Stranger Things 4 overall is great IMO. Corny at times, but it's Stranger Things, what are you expecting?

Watchmen (2019) is a great little series if you enjoyed the comic.

Currently watching The West Wing for the first time, it's super well written and funny, but the serious parts are just
too pompous and make me laugh every time.
