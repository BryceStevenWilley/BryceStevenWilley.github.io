## What is this? 

It's a now page: what I'm focused on at the moment, both professionally and personally.
It's what I'd tell on old co-worker if we met up for a 30 minute lunch.
Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff).
Trying to keep it updated at least monthly.

### Longer-viewing Career Stuff

Still at [Suffolk Law School's Legal Innovation and Technology (LIT) Lab](https://suffolklitlab.org/),
working on court forms. My position is grant funded, and ends in Q3 2023, so I'll be
looking for a new gig around then, but not quite right now. I have a variety of different
tech skill sets, and am not concerned about developing a few more, and am more interested in making sure
that I work at a place [helps under-served communities help themselves]({% post_url 2021-06-20-new_job %}).

## Personal

### Doing

Doing a lot of exploration of [Mastodon/Fediverse](), trying to figure out a way to enjoy non-corporate social
media.


### Listening To

Not listening to anything super deeply right now, but am listening to a lot of bangers.

## Gaming

Played [minit]() recently, it was pretty short, has a neat gimmick, and was fun for the length 
(beat it in about 90 minutes with 58% completion).

Currently playing through Red Dead Redemption 2. Not my normal type of game, but I'm
going through a list of all of the great games I've heard about on PS4.
