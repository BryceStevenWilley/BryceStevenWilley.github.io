## What is this? 

It's a now page: what I'm focused on at the moment, both professionally and personally.
It's what I'd tell on old co-worker if we met up for a 30 minute lunch.
Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff).
Trying to keep it updated at least monthly.

## Professional

### Work Stuff

Still at [Suffolk Law School's Legal Innovation and Technology (LIT) Lab](https://suffolklitlab.org/), working on court form software.
My main focus right now is to get our [efile-proxy](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/EfileProxyServer) (and corresponding [docassemble library](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-EFSPIntegration)) ready for a 1.0 release. That means I need to review and redo CI for testing, documentation, and some final security audits.

It also means making sure that [docassemble](https://docassemble.org) and our guided interviews built on top of it are accessible. I've been reading up and using on a lot of accessibility standards and tools, and am starting to write a blog post about that experience.

### Longer-viewing Career Stuff

working on court forms. My position at the LIT Lab is grant funded, and ends in Q3 2023, so I'll be
looking for a new gig around then! I have a variety of different
tech skill sets, and am not concerned about developing a few more, and am more interested in making sure
that I work at a place [helps under-served communities help themselves]({% post_url 2021-06-20-new_job %}).

## Personal

### Doing

Exploring [Mastodon/Fediverse](https://weirder.earth/@brycew/), trying to figure out a way to enjoy social media.

### Listening To

Not listening to anything super deeply right now, but am listening to a lot of bangers.

## Gaming

Currently playing through Red Dead Redemption 2. Not my normal type of game, but I'm
going through a list of all of the great games I've heard about on PS4.

Played [minit](https://minitgame.com/) recently. It was pretty short, has a neat gimmick, and was fun for the length 
(beat it in about 90 minutes with 58% completion).
