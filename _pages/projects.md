Here are some of my past projects: hope you can learn something from them or just enjoy them!
## Bodhi

[Bodhi](bodhi-repo) is a 2D platformer inspired by the Chinese novel, "Journey to the West". I handled
coding for the entire game using [cocos2d-x](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x), and
co-designed some of the levels with Mei Tan.

[Forest](forest-repo) is a procedurally-generated VR 'game' that a [friend](https://github.com/pjh5) and 
I coded for the Oculus Rift at HackRice 6 ([original vesion](https://github.com/BryceStevenWilley/oculus-hackrice16)).  It's working title was called "No Man's Forest", 
and was pretty much just a chance for us to make a VR game, It ended up being a blast. 
However, since I don't own a Rift, I had to port the game to Mac, which you can find
[here](forest-repo)! The installation isn't general yet (library locations are hardcoded to my machine, etc),
but feel free to open a Github issue if you want me to fix it/ a PR if you anything about CMake. 


## Android Apps

For earlier Hackathons, my teams and I made several android apps. They're all a little old,
so I don't know if they build for versions of android newer than L.

* [Pacer](pacer-repo), an app that chooses music based on your running pace at the moment.
* [Pandora's Pantry](pandora-repo), an app that gives you recipes you can make based off 
  ingredients that you have in your fridge. The app was one of the finalists at HackRice 4.

## Web Things

My old website was built with Angular and Dart, so I took the chance to play around with
some neat drawing demos. Since moving my site to Jekyll, there's not an easy way to port
those demos along with it, but they're still avaliable at my achived old site.
