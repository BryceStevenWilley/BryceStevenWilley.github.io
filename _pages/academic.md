## Motion Planning Background

Getting robots to move is a more difficult problem than it might seem.
Robots have to deal many different problems, including knowing what's around them (vision), knowing their location in a wider environment (mapping), determining how to move around by this wider environment (motion planning) and actually moving around in the environment (control and actuation).
