I'm Bryce, a robotics software engineer at [Realtime Robotics](https://rtr.ai) living in Boston, MA.
My mission is to make robots (significantly more) useful, (trivially) usable, and (actually, widely) used.

I received a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Theatre in 2017 and defended my [Master's Thesis](/academic) in August 2018 at Rice University.
My thesis is based on work in the [Kavraki Lab](http://www.kavrakilab.org/)
with [Lydia Kavraki](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~kavraki/) and [Mark Moll](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~mmoll/)
on autonomous robotic and vehicle motion.

I've contributed to [MoveIt](https://moveit.ros.org/about/), and I also have a side hobby of making video games: take a
look [here](/projects) to see more.

I run, read, bike, and advocate with [Dotbike](http://dotbike.org), the Dorchester Biking Club (I setup and designed their website).

I used to be a volunteer photographer at [BARC](http://www.houstontx.gov/barc/), and take my own pup, Jackie, for lots of long walks.

This website is built using Jekyll, and the
[base material theme](https://github.com/alexcarpenter/material-jekyll-theme) was made by [Alex Carpenter](https://alexcarpenter.me/).
The photos of me are from my friends [Yena Han](https://yenahan.squarespace.com) and [Grant Raun](https://www.grantraun.com).
