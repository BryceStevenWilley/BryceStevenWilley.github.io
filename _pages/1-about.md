I'm Bryce, a clinical fellow at the [Suffolk LIT Lab](https://suffolklitlab.org/), living in Boston, MA.
My mission is to make technology that works better for people.  

I received a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Theatre in 2017 and defended my [Master's Thesis](/academic) in August 2018, all at Rice University.
My thesis is based on work in the [Kavraki Lab](http://www.kavrakilab.org/)
with [Lydia Kavraki](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~kavraki/) and [Mark Moll](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~mmoll/)
on autonomous robotic motion planning algorithms. I then moved up to Boston and worked at [Realtime Robotics](https://rtr.ai), working on autonomous vehicle and industrial robot motion planning.

In the Summer of 2020, with the George Floyd protests and COVID-19 present and exposing deficiencies in our social systems, I reevaluated my career path, and decided to pivot.
I worked as a [Bluebonnet Data Fellow](https://www.bluebonnetdata.org/) with [Anthia Owens Carter](https://ballotpedia.org/Anthia_Carter) for Georgia, House District 47.
I then started a Fellowship with Suffolk LIT Lab, working on the [Document Assembly Line Project](https://suffolklitlab.org/doc-assembly-line/).
I am involved with [Code for Boston](https://www.codeforboston.org/) and [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/), specifically [GetYourRefund's](https://www.codeforamerica.org/programs/getyourrefund) volunteer experiment team.

I run, read, bike, and advocate with [Dotbike](http://dotbike.org), the Dorchester Biking Club (I setup and designed their website).

I used to be a volunteer photographer at [BARC](http://www.houstontx.gov/barc/), and take my own pup, Jackie, for lots of long walks.

This website is built using Jekyll, and the
[base material theme](https://github.com/alexcarpenter/material-jekyll-theme) was made by [Alex Carpenter](https://alexcarpenter.me/).
The photos of me are from my friends [Yena Han](https://yenahan.squarespace.com) and [Grant Raun](https://www.grantraun.com).
