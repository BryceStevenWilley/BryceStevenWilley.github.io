I'm Bryce, a robotics software engineer at [Realtime Robotics](https://rtr.ai).
I received a BS in Computer Science and an BA in Theatre in 2017 from Rice University, and I defended my Master's Thesis also at Rice University.
My thesis is based on work in the [Kavraki Lab](http://www.kavrakilab.org/)
with [Lydia Kavraki](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~kavraki/) and [Mark Moll](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~mmoll/)
on autonomous robotic motion.

I also have a side hobby of making video games: take a
look [here](/projects) to see more.

I run, cycle, am a volunteer photographer at [BARC](http://www.houstontx.gov/barc/), and take my own pup, Jackie, for lots of long walks.
