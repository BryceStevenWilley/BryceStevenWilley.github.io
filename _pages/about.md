I'm Bryce, a robotics software engineer at [Realtime Robotics](https://rtr.ai) living in Boston, MA.
I received a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Theatre in 2017 and defended my Master's Thesis in August 2018 at Rice University.
My thesis is based on work in the [Kavraki Lab](http://www.kavrakilab.org/)
with [Lydia Kavraki](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~kavraki/) and [Mark Moll](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~mmoll/)
on autonomous robotic and vehicle motion.

I also have a side hobby of making video games: take a
look [here](/projects) to see more.

I run, cycle, was a volunteer photographer at [BARC](http://www.houstontx.gov/barc/), and take my own pup, Jackie, for lots of long walks.

This website is built using Jekyll, and the
[base material theme](https://github.com/alexcarpenter/material-jekyll-theme) was made by [Alex Carpenter](https://alexcarpenter.me/).
The photos of me are from my friends [Yena Han](https://yenahan.squarespace.com) and [Grant Raun](www.grantraun.com).
