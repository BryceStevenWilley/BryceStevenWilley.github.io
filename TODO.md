# Idea list

* Implement dropdowns for projects?
* Something fun and interactive, just using simple js stuff
* Maybe continue some of the Rust learning projects, but actually publish them too?
* Writing actual blog posts
  * One about my photo editing process for BARC (and currently)
  * Maybe adapt some of the MoWs
