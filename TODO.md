# Idea list

* Implement dropdowns for projects?
* Writing actual blog posts
  * One about my photo editing process for BARC (and currently)
  * use the presentation for 640
  * The Industrial Robotics talk into a post?
  * Why I changed careers
* Add Analytics:
  * Try [Plasuible](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/) instead of Google Analytics
    * Working on Jekyll with [this plugin](https://awesomeopensource.com/project/hendrikschneider/jekyll-analytics)
  * Or [Gauges](https://get.gaug.es/)? Cheaper for 100k, but I might not ever even reach that.
