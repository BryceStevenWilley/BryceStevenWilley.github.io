# Idea list
Eventually just put these in Trello.
* Implement dropdowns for projects?
* Write something interesting. Maybe adapt some of the MoWs or
      use the presentation for 640.
* Something fun and interactive, just using simple js stuff
* Make some actually cool blender renders
* Maybe continue some of the Rust learning projects, but actually publish them too?
* Writing actual blog posts
  * One about my photo editing process for BARC (and currently)
  * One about how in programming you can do 1 thing 20 different ways, and 5 are recommended
