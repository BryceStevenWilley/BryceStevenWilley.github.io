Colors have almost always been just out of reach for me. They look wonderful! Blade Runner 2049
was my favorite movie for a while because of the palettes. La La Land still is. But at the same
time, if you'd ask me to come up with my own awesome colors, I'd either be baffeled, or I'd have the unearned confidence of a physisist entering a new field.

When I first started my website in late undergrad, I stayed simple. White background, black text, and dark blue theme color <span style="color:#1565C0;">⬤</span>,
heavily inspired by Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/design/).

I then, for some reason, decided that I needed a 'brand', and part of that was maintaining consistent colors on everything I did. 
I used these colors in some [presentations](https://brycewilley.xyz/comp600talk/) first, then eventualy redesigned the website around them.

The colors on my website were:
* Primary, a bright blue: <span style="color:#0090EA;">⬤</span>
* Secondary, a crazy bright yellow: <span style="color:#ffd90a;">⬤</span>
* Tertiary, a dark purple <span style="color:#66298c;">⬤</span>
* Text: white <span style="color:#ffffff;">⬤</span>

Why the hell did I go with these? Because they were fun! I'm by no means a web developer by trade, so making a website arguably isn't necessary, and I just sorta use it to try out and play around.
These colors were just me playing around, and choosing bright colors that match my personality.
However, my personality and general readability were at odds.

I posted [Visioning Texts](/visioning_texts/) on reddit with some of my data early this year, and got quite a bit more attention than I was expecting. While there was a lot of garbage comments, there were some constructive ones related to the color choice:
* "The blue background is extremely hideous"
* "It's just too much of a harsh contrast. Makes it difficult to focus on the data"
* "Colour palette could do better. Blue and yellow remind me of IKEA"

I definitely knew I needed to change. So I did.

## The actual Research

After reading listening to the above, I got to work. I wanted to keep the same fun-aspect to my site, while maybe being a little easier to look at and read, maybe a bit more seriouus. So, I just went through some movies/TV shows, scrolled through the time bar to scenes I remembered/were striking, and grabbed a few screenshots:
* Dark
* Neon Genesis: Evangelion
* Black Mirror (USS Calister)
* Blade Runner 2049
* Eternal Sunshine

I threw all of the sceen shots them together into some sort of collage really quick, and was surprised with the results. I thought I would have grabbed more scenes with blues in them, but the only one present was a scene from Evangelion, which has lots of bright blue skys in Tokyo-3.

I got a palette generated from it (on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/)), and got:
* Woody brown: #442a2d
* Whiskey: #d0935d
* De York: #88c484 (almost entirely from the EVA Unit-01)'s shoulders and arms
* Deluge: #7a68ac

I then played around for a long time in http://colorizer.org/ and https://coolors.co, playing around with the brightness values, which can [help the most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPeqyGig0vQ) with distinguishing the colors on the page, and occasionally the cyan/yellow scales, to make sure that none of my colors would be indisguishable for colorblind people. 

And here's the final result!
