## Work Stuff

It's been a while.

I left the IRS voluntarily last year during what was unarguably a shit time for federal employees.
I might write about my federal experience at some point, but there's not much to say that hasn't
already been said [^1].

Either way, I'm back at the Suffolk LIT Lab, at my same old role, which coincidentally opened back
up right before I decided to leave the IRS last year (and definitely played a part in that decision).
Working on a lot of the same work there, which is better recorded at [it's blog](https://suffolklitlab.org/blog/).

It's fine.

## Personal

### Doing

I dropped Spotify, and after a brief stint with Tidal, am just self-hosting [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)
as a Music streaming service, which is great. It just runs on my desktop, and I download whatever albums
I'm listening to at the moment to FinAmp on my phone. It just works. It's gotten me listening to my
older music library at lot more. 

Upgraded to PopOS! 24.04 recently. It's fine, but the desktop environment, Cosmic, kinda sucks. It's
really buggy, and just doesn't work like it should. Switched to Gnome, and it's fine.

I've become a bit of a home improvement DIY-er, painting my living room and working on making wall-to-wall shelves above the TV. Still in progress, maybe I'll post pics when I'm done with that.

### Listening To

A ton of great stuff since I last updated. Some favs:

* [Fat Dog](https://fatdogfatdogfatdog.bandcamp.com/album/woof) is my favorite new band, followed closely by [Touchdown Jesus](https://touchdownjesus.bandcamp.com/album/it-s-all-feast-or-famine).
* As is tradition, listened to a lot of Bad Bunny before and after his Superbowl performance.
* Graham Kartna has been around a while, but I only recently listened to his full length albums,
  ["For Your Safety and the Safety of Others"](https://grahamkartna.bandcamp.com/album/for-your-safety-and-the-safety-of-others), and it's incredibly catchy and surprisingly good
  song writing and lyricism.
* I'm about 7 years late, but Persona 5 has the best game soundtrack of all time. Been listening
  a lot to the [Silksong Soundtrack](https://christopherlarkin.bandcamp.com/album/hollow-knight-silksong-original-soundtrack) recently too.

### Gaming

I happened to break my leg after getting hit by a car on my bike last year, so I had a lot
of time to play games and got through a good chunk of my backlog.

* Balatro: fun game, but didn't keep me sucked in for more than a few days.
* Outer Wilds: amazing game. Go in blind.
* Persona 5: As mentioned above, incredible soundtrack. The gameplay I enjoyed less though, and it got extremely repetitive / grindy in the endgame.
* Read Dead Redemption 2: Similar complaints to Persona 5; the gameplay is fine, but gets so grindy by
  the end. But despite that, it tells a great story, and can't really be separated from all of that grind.
* Silksong: Good game, but idk, it crosses the line into not fun because of the boss difficulty. Set it down
  multiple times for like a month at a time when I got stuck on bosses, and just gave up at the Act 3 final boss.

### Reading

Read embarissingly little this last year.

* I did get through the entirety of Berserk, through the last Miura chapters. It's good, gorgeous, and has somehow affected even more of the media I consume that I thought it had.
* Getting through House of Leaves now, I like it, and enjoy the complexity, but storywise, I'm halfway through
  and feel like I've got it, I don't know what else they could do.
