title: A Year without Beef
---

I'm starting to write this as I approach a full year without eating beef. I forget the actualy day I
started, but sometime in January 2016, I stopped eating beef, followed a few weeks later by pork, and
I officialy went pescatarian in April.

### It makes you cook

Strangely enough going pescatarian made me slightly better at cooking. 

### It's not hard

Given the above, and that you tooo get a little better at cooking, not eating 
beef is not hard. Hell, even being Pescatarian isn't difficult. 

### Try it

I've been meaning to convince my parent and friends to also give up beef:
at least for 2 weeks. That's enough time to grocery shop without beef, so
it sets in a little stronger. Personally, after about 3 weeks, I didn't notice a change.
