title:How to Properly Clang Tidy
---

Clang tidy is an awesome tool.

Tried to follow http://www.labri.fr/perso/fleury/posts/programming/using-clang-tidy-and-clang-format.html, but didn't work on the scale of moveit.

Used run-clang-tidy-3.8.py.

TODO: look up other useful commands to explain for run-clang-tidy.
